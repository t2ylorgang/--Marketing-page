                    <p>The people of Tororo are among the poorest in Uganda and face many poverty issues including little or no access to livelihoods and healthcare and no education resources in schools. The SAFE Foundation started working with our partner organisation TOCIDA in 2009 and have a long term commitment to improving the lives of the local people in a manner that respects their traditional culture and basic human rights.</p>

                    <h3>The Program</h3>
                    <p>We provide a support package for the most vulnerable children who are suffering from health and disability issues and cannot access school without our help

                        We also train local people in the community to learn new skills such as craft making, baking and agricultural techniques to enable them to create small business and gain a sustainable income. In addition to this we teach social enterprise training to help people increase knowledge and skills in business.</p>

                    <h3>Our Impact</h3>
                    <p>We have provided tailored support packages for 180 of the most vulnerable children allowing them to access education.

                        We have taught over 50 community members skills in specific industries 
                        
                        We have improved access to training to over 200 members of the community
                        
                        We have equipped and stocked a village library to enable hundreds of people to access learning.</p>
